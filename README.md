# Magnify

Magnify is a World of Warcraft (1.12) addon offering simple quality of life features for the world map frame. The player can now zoom in and customize the scale of the world map player arrow.

The zoom feature is backported code from retail with several adjustments to make it work with the Vanilla client.
