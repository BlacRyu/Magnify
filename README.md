# Uncharted

Uncharted is a World of Warcraft Vanilla (1.12) addon that provides several world map enhancements. The addon is still in development and right now the only features available are a smaller world map frame and world map zoom.

The zoom feature is backported code from retai with several adjustments to make it work with the Vanilla client.
